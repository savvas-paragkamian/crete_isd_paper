    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This article concerns the Greek fauna of classical and late antiquity and changes up to the present day. The main sources for the fauna of antiquity are historical, geographical and zoological texts, as well as descriptions from travellers who visited Greece. The study of the texts of classical and late antiquity was based on the following classical authors: Xenophon, Aristotle, Aristophanes Byzantios, Pliny, Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch, Pausanias and Aelian. Some species that were present in the Greek fauna of classical and late antiquity, such as the lion and the leopard, are today extinct in Greece, whereas some other species that are now common, such as the cat, the chicken and the peacock, were introduced about that time or a little earlier from other regions. Some other species that are also common today, such as the wild rabbit and the pheasant, were unknown at that time, as they appeared later in Greece from other areas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract = {A recent study of desertification in Crete and the south Aegean has found few signs of climatic change or accelerated soil erosion. Increasing reliance on ground water presents a risk for the future. The main changes in the landscape are a great extension of the area under olives, and an increase in natural trees and bushes. More pines present a fire hazard. Burning of maquis by shepherds requires further examination. Migration, urbanisation and technological developments in agriculture in the last few decades have had a profound effect on Mediterranean landscapes. Depopulation of mountainous inland areas and small offshore islands results in a diminution of the historical and scenic value of their landscapes. This research project aims to identify and characterise landscapes in western Crete which are of special value and which are threatened by current developments; it attempts to trace changes in the last few decades, and to propose means of maintaining them in the future.}
